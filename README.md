_Helicoverpa zea_, the corn earworm is both a seed eater and a generalist, feeding on over 30 families of plants, including both agricultural crops and native plants such as _Lupinus Texensis_ (Texas bluebonnet). I observed that corn earworms exhibit highly variable feeding behavior and travel around the plant to feed from dispersed sources on the plant. In order to understand the effect of plant toxin defense on caterpillar growth, I fed corn earworms on varying concentration diets of _Lupinus texensis_ seeds (containing QAs). When monitoring their growth rate and mass in response to these various levels of plant defense chemicals, no difference was found between caterpillar development across different toxin levels. Instead, it appears that caterpillars which were exposed to greater toxin levels ate greater quantities of food in order to account for the foodâ€™s lower digestibility. Preliminary chemistry data suggests that the caterpillars do not house the defense chemicals in their body after consumption, instead excreting the defense chemicals in their frass (feces). These findings support the understanding that generalist caterpillars use variable food intake to promote appropriate growth and that they do not suffer from increased chemical defense in their host plants.
