## What are these nutritional indices?


I used nutritional indices (Waldbauer 1968) to determine how QA content might affect quantity of food eaten or quality of food processed by corn earworms. Indices provide a mechanism to compare the ability of corn earworms’ ability to digest and assimilate food and how these measures might change corn earworm feeding rate in response to QAs. To simplify, nutritional indices quantify the caterpillars’ relationship to the food they feed on: the digestibility of the food, the ease with which the food can be converted to new biomass, and how much food the growing caterpillar consumes.

**Approximate Digestibility**
How digestible is the food?

` AD = (Ingested - Feces)/ Feces `


**Efficiency of Conversion of Ingested Food**
How well is ingested food digested?

` ECI = Biomass Gain/Ingested `


**Efficiency of Conversion of Digested Food**
How well is ingested food coverted to biomass?

` ECD = Biomass Gain/ (Ingested-Feces) `


**Relative Consumption Rate**
How much food are they eating?

` RCR = Ingested/(Caterpillar Mass *Time) `


**Relative Growth Rate**
How fast are they growing?

` RGR = RCR*ECD*AD `


To calculate these indices, caterpillars were reared until molting to their forth instar (shedding the outermost layer of skin to grow quickly afterwards). In the process of molting, caterpillars fully excrete all material in their gut (Nijhout & Williams 1974). In order to properly calculate nutritional indices, the gut must start empty so all measurement are only made with respect to food eaten since the initiation of the experiment. Once caterpillars molted into their forth instar, they were placed in fresh (5.5 cm x 4 cm x 3 cm) containers, and given food of the corresponding treatment which they had been fed on since hatching. Only individuals in the control (0%), 20% and 60% treatments were used for this experiment. In order to analyze the nutritional effect of the food according to the procedure outlined in Waldbauer 1968 (adapted by Schmidt and Resse 1985), caterpillars and their initial food were weighed. The caterpillar was then left to feed and excrete frass for 24 hours. At this point, each individual was checked to make sure it still had enough remaining food. If it had eaten more than half of the food, the caterpillar was removed to a new clean container. Its frass weight and remaining weight of food were recorded and it was given a new piece of weighed artificial diet. After the next 24 hours (totaling 48) the caterpillar, frass and remaining food were weighed and the caterpillar was placed in a fresh container without diet. The caterpillar was then left for 8 additional hours to complete its digestive cycle and excrete fully. After the 8 hours, the caterpillar and remaining frass are collected.
